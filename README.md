### Dashboard for Finance, Sales, Marketing and Supply Chain

AtliQ Hardwares is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but is not able to compete with other companies using data as most of their report still exists in Excel. My goal is to implement an advanced analytics solution using Power BI that will enable the company to get insights and make informed decisions.
